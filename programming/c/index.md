# Introduction to Programming in C

To get started, I recommend working through Jens Gustedt's
[Modern C](https://gustedt.gitlabpages.inria.fr/modern-c/) **textbook**. It is
available online, free of charge, or can bought in any decend bookshop.

If you prefer watching **video tutorials** rather than working through a book,
I recommend
[C Programming for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL98qAXLA6aftD9ZlnjpLhdQAOFI8xIB6e).

For learning any programming language it is most important to write your own
code. As a student of HTL Bulme, you may use the provided
[SSH access to our sandbox server](/linux/ssh.html).
