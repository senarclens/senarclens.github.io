# NodeJS

To install nodejs, simply use your package manager

```shell
sudo apt install nodejs
```

If you require a different version, it can still be installed using your
package manager. For example, follow the instructions of the
NodeSource project which provides, among others, Node.js binary distributions
for 
[Debian](https://github.com/nodesource/distributions?tab=readme-ov-file#debian-and-ubuntu-based-distributions).
