# Introduction to Programming in C++

{% assign presentations = "https://study.find-santa.eu/presentations/cpp/" %}

To get started, I recommend working through the free, community based
[Introduction to C++](https://cpp-lang.net/learn/course/) online tutorial.

Since the above tutorial is rather new and not yet complete, you may also
want to consult the older
[Learn C++](https://www.learncpp.com/) online tutorial. Note that there
are a lot of advertisements if you aren't using an ad blocker.

If you want to invest in an excellent C++ book, I recommend buying
[Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++](https://amzn.to/40EaSX2)
by Bjarne Stroustrup, the designer and original creator of C++.

If you prefer watching **video tutorials** rather than working through a book,
I recommend
[C++ Tutorial for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLnPwxZdW4Y).

For learning any programming language it is most important to write your own
code. As a student of HTL Bulme, you may use the provided
[SSH access to our sandbox server](/linux/ssh.html).

C++ reference documentation can be found at
[cppreference.com](https://en.cppreference.com/w/).
