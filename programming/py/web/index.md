# Python Web Applications

There are many packages that allow you to create web applications using
Python. Some of them allow very rapid prototypes for small applications.
A noteworthy example is [NiceGUI](https://nicegui.io/) which can be used to
create web frontends to scripting applications.

There are also large, comprehensive packages implementing the
model-view-controller MVC pattern. These include
[Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) and
[Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/). Both allow building the server
side of web applications with a REST addon and both offer great tutorials:

* [Django tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/intro/tutorial01/)
* [Flask tutorial](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/tutorial/)
