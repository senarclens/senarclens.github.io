# Introduction to wxPython

In order to install the required software, make sure that
`pip` (a tool for installing and managing Python packages) is available

```shell
sudo apt install python3-pip
```

Once `pip` is available, install the required dependencies via

```shell
pip install --upgrade --user wxpython
```

From now on, you should be able to `import wx` in your python programs.
To get started with GUI programming in Python, follow the official wxPython
tutorial
