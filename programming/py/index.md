# Introduction to Programming in Python

{% assign presentations = "https://study.find-santa.eu/presentations/py/" %}

Make sure you have `python` and all required packages installed.
Consult the [notes on installing Python](installation.html) if needed.

To get started, I recommend working through the official
[Python tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/).
If you prefer a book, you might want to get Allen B. Downey's
[Think Python 2e](https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/) **textbook**.
It is available online, free of charge, or can bought in any decent bookshop
(e.g. on [Amazon](https://amzn.to/3O1TKqW)).

If you prefer watching **video tutorials** rather than working through a book,
have a look at
[Introduction to Python 3](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAW1Fsz27UuaLYfGBmXM7nHur2XpNuIeD).

For learning any programming language it is most important to write your own
code. As a student of HTL Bulme, you may use the provided
[SSH access to our sandbox server](/linux/ssh.html).

Python reference documentation can be found at
[docs.python.org](https://docs.python.org/3/).
