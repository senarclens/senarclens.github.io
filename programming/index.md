# Programming Notes

The best way to learn programming is to write code. The following sites
offer many different programming challanges. Choose one of the sites, sign
up (you can use your GitHub account for single sign on) and start coding.
Have fun!

<!-- 
test the following sites and add them if they are good and essentially ad-free
<li><a href="https://codeally.io/">CodeAlly</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.hackerearth.com/">HackerEarth</a></li>

* [Exercism](https://exercism.org/) (open source,
  see [exercism on GitHub](https://github.com/exercism))
* [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/r/Kh4MaA)
* [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com)

If you're already fluent with one of more languages and want to work on
substantial projects, have a look at

* [Good First Issue](https://goodfirstissue.dev/)
* [Best Open Source Programs For Students to Participate](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/best-open-source-programs-for-students-to-participate/)

Particularly the latter gives good starting points that may even be used for
final year projects. Also, recruiters in IT companies will be impressed
if you have a successful portfolio of open source contributions!
