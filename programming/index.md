# Programming

## Programming Challenges
The best way to learn programming is to write code. The following sites
offer many different programming challanges. Choose one of the sites, sign
up (you can use your GitHub account for single sign on) and start coding.
Have fun!

<!-- 
test the following sites and add them if they are good and essentially ad-free
<li><a href="https://codeally.io/">CodeAlly</a></li>

* [Exercism](https://exercism.org/) (open source,
  see [exercism on GitHub](https://github.com/exercism))
* [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/r/Kh4MaA)
* [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com)

If you're already fluent with one of more languages and want to work on
substantial projects, have a look at

* [Good First Issue](https://goodfirstissue.dev/)
* [Best Open Source Programs For Students to Participate](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/best-open-source-programs-for-students-to-participate/)

Particularly the latter gives good starting points that may even be used for
final year projects. Also, recruiters in IT companies will be impressed
if you have a successful portfolio of open source contributions!

## Lecture Notes for Printing
If you prefer reading printed lecture notes, you might like the documents
created by the EU Future IT Professionals EDucation (FITPED) program.
They contain, among others, resources on databases, web development, git,
Python and C++. The documents are available on
[FITPED website](https://fitped.eu/outputs/). Note that, however, these
documents are not really aligned with my courses.
